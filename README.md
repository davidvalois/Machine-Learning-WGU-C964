# Machine Learning - Computer Science Capstone Project, WGU C964 

This project was completed as a Google Colab notebook, EnergyAnalysis.ipynb.  The CSV data files are referenced to a shared Google Drive folder: /content/drive/MyDrive/WGU-C964/

## Notebook file contents:
### New England Electric Power Operations 2010-2022
1. Import Python Data Analysis Libraries
2. Data Exploration
- Load Data and Inspect Features
- Feature Selection and Identifying Data Problems
- Data Cleaning
- Data Verification and Export
3. Descriptive Statistics: Table of Summary Statistics by Fuel Type
4. Data Visualization
- Visualization 1: Consumption for Electricity Generation vs. Total Consumption
- Visualization 2: Total Generation by Fuel Type
- Visualization 3: Total Consumption by Fuel Type
5. Data Analysis
- Model Dataset Preparation
- Model Training
- Model Testing
- Models with Predictive Properties

## Original Use instructions:
The Energy Analysis application requires access to the shared Google Drive folder with a shortcut in the user My Drive folder.  The application must access the folder with this path to load the data from the CSV and other file operations.  If the shortcut is not created, the application will fail to run properly. *(A shared link to the Google Drive folder was provided when the project was submitted)*

**Accessing the application files**
1. Click on the left menu “Shared with Me”
2. Right click on the folder “WGU-C964” and select “Add shortcut to Drive”
3. Select “My Drive” then click “Add”
4. Click into the “WGU-C964” folder and double click “EnergyAnalysis.ipynb”
5. The shortcut can be removed by right clicking on it and selecting “Remove”

## Project takeaways
The energy dataset was not ideal for the analysis, and the project would have been easier with a different choice.  The STL analysis was interesting, and using the SARIMA optimization to determine parameters was an unexpected result from where I started.  Coding the data inspection and data cleaning was the most useful takeaway since the technique could be applied to other datasets.  The notebook is over commented, but better safe than sorry with an academic project.  The project was passed on the first submission.
